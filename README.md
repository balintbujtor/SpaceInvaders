# SpaceInvaders
This is a project made during my Erasmus mobility period in Bologna, Italy with the University of Bologna. The project was made for the Autonomous and Adaptive Systems course. The project implements a deep learning agent that can play the Space Invaders Atari game. The project also includes a report written in LaTex and a presentation, that were mandatory for the course.
